# Hands-On Selenium WebDriver with Java [![][Logo]][GitHub Repository]

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of examples about [Selenium] 4 using [Java] as language binding. These examples are explained in the O'Reilly book [Hands-On Selenium WebDriver with Java].

[![][Cover]][Hands-On Selenium WebDriver with Java]

This repo has been implemented as a multi-module project (using [Maven] and [Gradle] as build tools) composed of tests based on different frameworks: [JUnit 4], [JUnit 5] (alone or extended with [Selenium-Jupiter]), and [TestNG].

## Practice site

This repo also contains a [Practice site], i.e., a representative set of sample web pages used as the system under test (SUT) in the Selenium WebDriver test examples. This site is hosted using [GitHub Pages].

## Tags

This repo uses Git tags to track the evolution of the codebase in time. These tags are the following:

* `1.0.0`: The examples of the first version of the book (released in April 2022) are based on this tag.
* `1.1.0`: Bump to Java 11, due to the incompatibility of TestNG 7.6.0 (released on May 18, 2022) with Java 8.
